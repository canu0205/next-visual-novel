# Introduction
The game is an on-chain visual novel created using the World Engine.
Using the GPT-4 API, players can type sentences to feel like they're talking to real in-game NPCs.
It's a multiplayer game set in a high school, where players compete to be the first to reach a favorability rating of 100 with one of five NPCs.
The game utilizes a world engine, which gives us more freedom to modify the client and plugins.
Users will be able to modify and play the visual novel according to their own preferences, which is why we created an on-chain visual novel.

# Features
### Modding
A Fully On Chain Game is a game where all of the game's data and logic resides on the blockchain, giving it the advantage of being moddable. 
This gives the game a longer lifespan.
It also allows the game to evolve in a variety of ways and build a large number of loyal fans who can be deeply involved in the game.

### Text-based Visual Novel
Text-based Visual Novel is characterized by the fact that it uses writing as its primary medium, allowing for detailed and deep storytelling.
This allows users to immerse themselves more deeply in the characters and the story.
It's also portable to a variety of platforms, and users can change the course of the story or experience different endings based on their choices. This has the advantage of high replay value.
By simply changing the prompts, different genres and themes can be explored, making them inexpensive and flexible to produce, allowing for unique and novel stories or worlds to be experienced.
