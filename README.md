# Introduction
The game is an on-chain visual novel created using the World Engine.
Using the GPT-4 API, players can type sentences to feel like they're talking to real in-game NPCs.
It's a multiplayer game set in a high school, where players compete to be the first to reach a favorability rating of 100 with one of five NPCs.
The game utilizes a world engine, which gives us more freedom to modify the client and plugins.
Users will be able to modify and play the visual novel according to their own preferences, which is why we created an on-chain visual novel.
